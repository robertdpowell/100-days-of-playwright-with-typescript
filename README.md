## Day 1 
### Setting up 
I will be using Github Codespaces for this 100 day learning challenge. So that each new codespace in my Github repository launches with the VSCode extensions that I will be working with, today I created a devcontainer.json file. I expect this congiguration file will expand over time, so this is just a start. 

```
{
  "name": "My Codespace",
  "extensions": [
    "GitHub.copilot",
    "ms-playwright.playwright"
  ]
}
```
